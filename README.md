## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was great for practicing more complex CSS by creating illustrations and icons. I feel more confident in my ability to to do this in the future.

### Continued development

I didn't get around to building the bonus feature of animating the chat illustration on page load. If I revisit this project in the future, I plan on completing this as well.
